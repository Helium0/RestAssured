# This is my another private project where I check my knowledge about API testing. For this purpose I used https://petstore.swagger.io/. 

So far I managed and created tests for simple CRUD user endpoints.
My goal is to extend those tests for the other user endpoints. Also I want to take care of on another areas like pet and store.

What I used in my project:
- Java programming Language
- Selenium and Maven tools
- OOP methodology
- KISS and DRY programming principles

There are different approchaes for creating dummy data and I choosed 2 of them:
- providing data from excel file
- using additional library called Faker library
